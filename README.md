# Unsupervised machine learning class

This notebook is my project for a unsupervised Machine Learning course at CU Boulder.

Mall_customer_segmentation.ipynb is the entire project and it includes comparing various clustering models to cluster customers. Using the cluster labels, we can bin people into these clusters with supervised learning. If more data was available about these people, we could recommend certian products to within cluster customers.
